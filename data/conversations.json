So first of all, I'm talking about hair color and lightener, not the mystery chemicals in store bought box dye and bleach. It's  a given the store bought crap is going to fry your hair. Hair color, well as lightener, when properly applied,  will not \"damage the roots\". That's not how hair works. The products cannot go in your follicle. Second of all, hair color and lightener will not change the color your hair grows in with, it can only change the color once it has beenn pushed out of the follicle. Thirdly, neither color or lightener will cause hair loss when applied properly.  You're more likely to get a chemical burn with lightener versus color but the human body does this thing where it can fix and regenerate things on a small scale like hair follicles. Fourth, you're incorrectly referring to new growth as \"roots\". That's not what a root is. Do I need to continue?",
