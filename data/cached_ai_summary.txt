Sentiment analysis reveals a predominantly positive tone (49%), followed by neutral (32%) and negative (8%) sentiments.  A lack of key discussion trends indicates a need for more engaging content.  To boost engagement, consider focusing content creation on topics of interest to the audience, experimenting with different content formats (e.g., videos, polls, stories), and running contests or giveaways.  Analyzing competitor strategies could also provide valuable insights.  Finally, encouraging interaction from the top active users could help generate momentum.
