Pero antes de ser una estrella, soy hijo de Dios, el hijo del que cre\u00f3 esta Tierra sobre la que hoy usted camina.\n\nEn mis a\u00f1os en Estados Unidos, he recorrido el pa\u00eds, explorado su cultura, comido en sus mejores restaurantes y disfrutado de la vida al m\u00e1ximo. Y \u00bfsabe qu\u00e9? Me he sentido en casa. Me he sentido querido y amado.\n\nPero hoy no vengo a pedirle nada, vengo a recordarle una verdad innegable: los venezolanos en EE.UU. son trabajadores, aportan a este pa\u00eds y lo hacen brillar. M\u00e1s de 600,000 venezolanos est\u00e1n aqu\u00ed, y el 99% de ellos contribuye con esfuerzo y talento.\n\nS\u00e9 que su atenci\u00f3n suele estar en cosas m\u00e1s \u201cimportantes\u201d como su Coca Light de McDonald\u2019s, pero esc\u00facheme bien: nos necesita. Somos exquisitos, estamos a la moda, somos bellos, tenemos clase y una ambici\u00f3n que no conoce l\u00edmites. No somos mediocres.\n\nDe hecho, a muchos de nosotros nos va mejor que al promedio de quienes nacieron aqu\u00ed. No le conviene perder este recurso humano de oro. \u00bfNo ser\u00eda m\u00e1s estrat\u00e9gico darnos la ciudadan\u00eda americana? Pi\u00e9nselo. Tenernos en EE.UU. es un lujo.\n\nDesde Nueva York, a la fecha de hoy.\n\nXOXO, besos y abrazos.\n\nNeuroKiller, de la Casa Blanca.",
