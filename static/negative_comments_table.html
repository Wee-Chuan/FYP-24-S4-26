But dig a little deeper, and the cracks in this approach become glaring. It\u2019s the economic equivalent of setting fire to your neighbor\u2019s house and then wondering why your own living room is getting smoky. Tariffs are taxes, plain and simple. They don\u2019t just land on foreign companies; they land on American consumers. That means when a shipment of tomatoes or avocados from Mexico arrives at the border, the cost jumps by 25% before it even hits grocery store shelves. Businesses aren\u2019t going to eat that cost\u2014they\u2019ll pass it along to the consumer. And if you\u2019re a working-class family already stretched thin, suddenly that simple bag of groceries is noticeably more expensive. The estimate that food costs will rise by 3% overall might sound small, but that\u2019s an average across all food products. The real pain will be felt in categories that depend heavily on imports\u2014like fresh vegetables in winter, where 60% come from Mexico. A 25% tariff there isn\u2019t just a minor bump; it\u2019s a full-on price surge that households will feel every time they go shopping. Then there\u2019s the domino effect. Mexico and Canada aren\u2019t just sources of imports; they are the United States\u2019 largest trading partners. Nearly 30% of all U.S. imports come from these two countries. Hit them with tariffs, and they\u2019re going to hit back. That\u2019s how trade wars work. The last time the U.S. got into a tariff battle, farmers in the Midwest found themselves with stockpiles of soybeans and no buyers, while manufacturers saw supply chains thrown into chaos. This isn\u2019t theoretical\u2014it\u2019s history, repeating itself. Consider the auto industry. Car manufacturing today is a tightly integrated process, with parts flowing back and forth across borders before a finished vehicle rolls off the assembly line. A 25% tariff on those parts doesn\u2019t mean Mexico and Canada pay more\u2014it means car prices in America go up, factories slow down, and workers face layoffs. A policy meant to protect American jobs could end up putting thousands of them at risk.
