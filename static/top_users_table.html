How will you improve the life of every American who is struggling?  Renaming the Gulf of Mexico, Tariffs, drilling, Panama Canal, Mars and all the other unnecessary actions are your ego and billionaires friends. You are the president of the people until you make it a better world for average Americans (Likes: 870)<br>@geraldina3116 I watched it live. There was nothing about helping you improve costs of healthcare and drugs etc. I took notes (Likes: 4)</td>

(Likes: 62)<br>@lonnie_mills9 That is exactly what I saw too. "OH, really?" came out of his mouth at least once. And the wombats don't bother me - I can't  wait to laugh at them when they lose everything! (Likes: 0)<br>No, he doesn't! Whoever that is handing them to him states the title, and he signs. The only time he said anything was when he said, "Oh! Really!" Other than that, he does not explain anything. (Likes: 0)<br>@hearttoheartpomeranians I went to whitehouse.gov and read most of them last night. At least the ones that he might win in court - NOTHING to help the American people! Rolling back decades, and centuries, of progress mostly! (Likes: 0)<br>@nysto308 "They are all there because he wanted them there"? I guess he supports Project 2025 after all. (Likes: 0)</td>
