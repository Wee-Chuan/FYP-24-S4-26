You should be applauding it instead of questioning the decision (Likes: 17176)<br>@ddorian17 yeah I know but decisions like this should be applauded not questioned. It's the only right decision here (Likes: 15)<br>Hahaha tripping on the grass? Mate he was flying (Likes: 9)<br>@ddorian17 appreciate it, thanks (Likes: 2)<br>Hahaha how can you be so blind. Go to the optometrist fast (Likes: 1)<br>@nickcanj yeah of course it was a clear dive. That should be punished with a yellow card, no questions asked. Diving should be banned from football fast and this is the way to do it (Likes: 3)<br>No need, my eyes and brains are perfectly fine (Likes: 0)<br>@ak6_miami by watching the game and the replay? It was pretty obvious (Likes: 0)<br>üòÇüòÇüòÇ you clearly don't understand football (Likes: 0)<br>@giuseppe__gennaro_ be objective here (Likes: 0)<br>@ethvn.h no way, look it back (Likes: 0)<br>@_parme_ that's mean (Likes: 0)<br>@vecchio_cuore_rossonero_ should have been yellow that's true (Likes: 0)<br>@rodrimedinaceli99 true he should have given a yellow card there as well (Likes: 0)<br>@ethvn.h I don't agree with you on that. It was a dive and that's awarded with a yellow card. It was the right decision (Likes: 0)<br>@ethvn.h fair everyone entitled to their own opinion (Likes: 1)<br>@andrescruzr13 a good referee follows the rules no matter the player. (Likes: 0)<br>@bo.rgodio I agree that he should have given a yellow card on the other occasions as well. However that makes this particular decision not wrong only the other ones were wrong (Likes: 0)<br>@djmyoutthd so when a player comes in with a dangerous tackle and attempt to break someone's leg that should not be punished when it's a first foul? (Likes: 0)<br>@djmyoutthd and btw a dive is a foul (Likes: 0)<br>@djmyoutthd it shouldn't matter whether it's the first time or not. Diving is foul play and should not be allowed (Likes: 0)</td>
