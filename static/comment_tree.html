Notable instances include:\n**Attempt to End Birthright Citizenship:** On January 21, 2025, President Trump signed an executive order aiming to end birthright citizenship for children born in the U.S. to non-citizen parents. This move challenges the 14th Amendment, which grants citizenship to all individuals born on U.S. soil. In response, 18 Democratic state attorneys general filed lawsuits asserting that the order violates constitutional rights. \n**Pardons Related to January 6 Capitol Riot:** On his first day back in office, Trump issued pardons for over 1,000 individuals involved in the January 6 Capitol riot. Critics argue that these pardons undermine the rule of law and the constitutional principle of accountability for actions against the democratic process. \n**Call for Termination of the Constitution:** In December 2022, Trump posted on social media calling for the \"termination\" of the Constitution to overturn the 2020 election results and reinstate him to power. Such statements directly challenge the foundational legal framework of the nation. \n**Claims of Absolute Immunity:** In legal proceedings, Trump has argued that the Constitution grants him absolute immunity for actions taken while in office, even if they are criminal. This interpretation has been widely criticized for potentially placing the president above the law, conflicting with the system of checks and balances integral to the Constitution. \nThese actions have prompted significant legal challenges and debates among constitutional scholars, reflecting concerns about the preservation of constitutional norms and the balance of powers in the U.S. government."}, {"color": "#c9d2df", "id": "18046635008239285", "label": "Comment 18046635008239285", "shape": "dot", "size": 10, "title": "Community: conversation_8\u003cbr\u003e@shellylee0520 not only that, apparently people don\u0027t realize some things don\u0027t change over night.
