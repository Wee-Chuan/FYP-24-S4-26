So you are saying MAGA was his first term even though he used it prior and during 😂. In order for America to be great again, it had to be great first then it wasn’t. Now during his first term we wanted to make it great again. Hence the word AGAIN. So when was it great? During his first term he was trying to make it great again.

Nearly 100% are received by liberals. It's such a disingenuous take to label your opponent as uneducated when what sets you apart is an overwhelming majority of those individuals getting into debt over a useless degree. It's a textbook midwit take to think that college education alone is impactful to one's personal education and intelligence. It probably isn't a good idea to insult a large portion of your voter base just to make an intellectually dishonest case. This kind of thinking is probably why the Democrats lost ground in almost every single county. Perhaps you catch more flies with honey, but that's just me. Computer science major btw",

Aí vc está bem equivocada, pq aí não se trata mais de querer de gostar, e sim dos fatos e sobre isso PAÍS mesmo são aqueles QUE FIZERAM ACONTECER e se destacaram POSITIVIVAMENTE ao longo da história.  Então país mesmo são somente os de 1.º mundo, os que buscaram chegar nesse nível e trabalharam pra isso. DEFINITIVAMENTE não é o caso do Brasil e os números dizem isso, os resultados dizem isso, as posições do BR nos mais diversos RANKINGS  QUALITATIVOS dizem isso. LOGO, não, não infelizmente o Brasil não é o melhor país de todos. Em todo continente Americano temos bem a frente EUA e Canadá nessa posição, Na américa CEntral estamos vendo despontar é El Salvador um país que nunca pensei em admirar um dia. Já na América do Sul o Brasil parece ser somente um Grande bobalhão, gigante pela própria natureza, com um potencial imenso, mas nunca disse a que veio de fato, perdendo diversas janelas de oportunidades da história recente e tem apenas se arrastado diante de tantos problemas e adversidades. E pra piorar as pessoas estão ignorando completamente o quão Pilantra Marçal é com provas mais absolutas do seu  mal caratismo e mesmo assim ainda falam em votar nele.",

                "text": "@mmmdva Yes, there is substantial evidence that Donald Trump has taken actions which many view as undermining the U.S. Constitution. Notable instances include:\n**Attempt to End Birthright Citizenship:** On January 21, 2025, President Trump signed an executive order aiming to end birthright citizenship for children born in the U.S. to non-citizen parents. This move challenges the 14th Amendment, which grants citizenship to all individuals born on U.S. soil. In response, 18 Democratic state attorneys general filed lawsuits asserting that the order violates constitutional rights. \n**Pardons Related to January 6 Capitol Riot:** On his first day back in office, Trump issued pardons for over 1,000 individuals involved in the January 6 Capitol riot. Critics argue that these pardons undermine the rule of law and the constitutional principle of accountability for actions against the democratic process. \n**Call for Termination of the Constitution:** In December 2022, Trump posted on social media calling for the \"termination\" of the Constitution to overturn the 2020 election results and reinstate him to power. Such statements directly challenge the foundational legal framework of the nation. \n**Claims of Absolute Immunity:** In legal proceedings, Trump has argued that the Constitution grants him absolute immunity for actions taken while in office, even if they are criminal. This interpretation has been widely criticized for potentially placing the president above the law, conflicting with the system of checks and balances integral to the Constitution. \nThese actions have prompted significant legal challenges and debates among constitutional scholars, reflecting concerns about the preservation of constitutional norms and the balance of powers in the U.S. government.",

Thank god it wasn't nowadays cause the doctors would be like covid and put me on a ventilator and I would for sure have died. It was incredible suffering. Dry heaving and can even get a drink. Always hungry and dehydrated. I'd choke and puke in my sleep. After a few weeks I could puke into a bucket without even waking up. If I was told I had whooping cough now I probably would kill myself. Nobody should have to suffer through Whooping cough. It currently kills 250 000 children worldwide every year. The vaccine prevents death and lowers risk of catching it. Legitimately.",

Well he signed an order that insurance companies don't have to treat you. But that's not important to your kind. How about he rolled back prescription savings. Oh I'm sure he'll send you a check for grandma's meds. Hmmm how about shutting down the health organization from telling us when there's diseases or viruses in the air. You know, how he purposely didn't tell AMEICANS they were at risk of dying. Yeah, keep praying to your orange Jesus.",
