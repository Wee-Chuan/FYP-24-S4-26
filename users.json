                "text": "@mmmdva Yes, there is substantial evidence that Donald Trump has taken actions which many view as undermining the U.S. Constitution. Notable instances include:\n**Attempt to End Birthright Citizenship:** On January 21, 2025, President Trump signed an executive order aiming to end birthright citizenship for children born in the U.S. to non-citizen parents. This move challenges the 14th Amendment, which grants citizenship to all individuals born on U.S. soil. In response, 18 Democratic state attorneys general filed lawsuits asserting that the order violates constitutional rights. \n**Pardons Related to January 6 Capitol Riot:** On his first day back in office, Trump issued pardons for over 1,000 individuals involved in the January 6 Capitol riot. Critics argue that these pardons undermine the rule of law and the constitutional principle of accountability for actions against the democratic process. \n**Call for Termination of the Constitution:** In December 2022, Trump posted on social media calling for the \"termination\" of the Constitution to overturn the 2020 election results and reinstate him to power. Such statements directly challenge the foundational legal framework of the nation. \n**Claims of Absolute Immunity:** In legal proceedings, Trump has argued that the Constitution grants him absolute immunity for actions taken while in office, even if they are criminal. This interpretation has been widely criticized for potentially placing the president above the law, conflicting with the system of checks and balances integral to the Constitution. \nThese actions have prompted significant legal challenges and debates among constitutional scholars, reflecting concerns about the preservation of constitutional norms and the balance of powers in the U.S. government.",

So you are saying MAGA was his first term even though he used it prior and during 😂. In order for America to be great again, it had to be great first then it wasn’t. Now during his first term we wanted to make it great again. Hence the word AGAIN. So when was it great? During his first term he was trying to make it great again. When was it great before his first term? What is so hard to understand?  It is like I’m talking to a toddler over here 😂.",

Nearly 100% are received by liberals. It's such a disingenuous take to label your opponent as uneducated when what sets you apart is an overwhelming majority of those individuals getting into debt over a useless degree. It's a textbook midwit take to think that college education alone is impactful to one's personal education and intelligence. It probably isn't a good idea to insult a large portion of your voter base just to make an intellectually dishonest case.

Oh I'm sure he'll send you a check for grandma's meds. Hmmm how about shutting down the health organization from telling us when there's diseases or viruses in the air. You know, how he purposely didn't tell AMEICANS they were at risk of dying. Yeah, keep praying to your orange Jesus.",
